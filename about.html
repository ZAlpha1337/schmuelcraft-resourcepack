        <h1>about me!</h1>
        <p>i have came from afar among many things, one of them is games!</p>
        <p>from playing games to modding games, i can add some funny modifications from adding a nextbot, let alone three from <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=english&id=2943004117" title="my steam page for the Schmuel Nextbot"> Steam!</a> For those that have garry's mod</p>
        <blockquote>trust me, coding and editing would sometimes be a pain because of loading into the map everytime with it.</blockquote>
        <p>not only i play and mod games, i also make music, animate on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx5fGKYvF2cnyo1tlyZsZGQ" title="Latest animation channel">YouTube Channel called Sandbox Cinematics.</a> I'm telling you if you check out the channel, most videos are going to be based off of Garry's Mod animations. Which I took a lot of blood, sweat and tears making not one but 2 videos.</p>
        <blockquote>PS; most of the dailouge is ment for mature sitcom show settings among the demographic.</blockquote>
        <p>how did i game on my pc right now it's a good question.</p>
