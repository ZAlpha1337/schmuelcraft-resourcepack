        <h1>about me!</h1>
        <p>i have came from afar among many things, one of them is games!</p>
        <p>from playing games to modding games, i can add some funny modifications from adding a nextbot, let alone three from <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?l=english&id=2943004117" title="my steam page for the Schmuel Nextbot"> Steam!</a> For those that have garry's mod</p>
        <blockquote>trust me, coding and editing would sometimes be a pain because of loading into the map everytime with it.</blockquote>
        <p>Me personally i have came a LONG way since the early 2000's. My early childhood got me hooked onto computers, and since then, i have major interests of playing on computers, and owning my own (which i do today ðŸ˜ƒ) and now working on other computers. sometimes my own computer. If I am working on a computer, it ain't going to be on my main computer, it'll be on an older computer which i would consider it a <q>retro build</q> among my style. The retro PC of how its built, shows its age, which released in the Windows Vista days, which that was released sometime in 2006. Some of you folks reading this right now may consider it a childhood charm, well, i couldn't agree more!</p>
        <p>Since my childhood, i was heavily interested in playing games on a computer, which thank god for flash games being invented. BTW i use <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/">flashpoint</a> to reuse the memories of my childhood.</p>
        <p>though i am not that much of a console gamer cause i wanted to game more often on PC. hence why internet memes like the following:</p>

        <p>not only i play and mod games, i also make music, animate on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx5fGKYvF2cnyo1tlyZsZGQ" title="Latest animation channel">YouTube Channel called Sandbox Cinematics.</a> I'm telling you if you check out the channel, most videos are going to be based off of Garry's Mod animations. Which I took a lot of blood, sweat and tears making not one but 2 videos.</p>
        <blockquote>PS; most of the dailouge is ment for mature sitcom show settings among the demographic.</blockquote>
        <p>how did i game on my pc right now it's a good question.</p>
