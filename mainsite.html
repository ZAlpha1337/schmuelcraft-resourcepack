        <h1>Welcome to the website where I post the SchmuelCraft resource pack for Minecraft Java only!</h1>

        <h2>About the packs</h2>
        <h3>Schmuelcraft</h3>
        <p><b>These are dedicated for the use of Java Minecraft only. At this time, there is a small possibility that there is going to be a bedrock version of this resource pack. Only time will tell when that'll happen.</b></p>
        <p><b>These packs are kept on a google drive for a while at this point, so i would send the dedicated link how you can download them directly from this website for free!</b></p>
        <p><b>The one main idea is to make him mad! YouTube may or may not accept this for what it is and how it was created, but hey! at I got a website dedicated for minecraft resource packs!</b></p>
        <p>hence why on the one text there is a line called; <q>is he gonna be mad when he sees this?</q></p>
        <blockquote>to get the resource pack, the minecraft launcher with java included is recommended when you buy minecraft on the Microsoft store, which is around $30 plus tax, depends if you're from North America, specifically the United states. You can click <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc">here</a> to view the price for your country. It could be UK's British pounds, Austrailian Dollars, Canadian Dollars, etc.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>where ever you are from, prices may vary, even if they are on sale, prices still vary!</blockquote>
        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p><b>This all started in 2019. My one friend named Connor actually decided to make up a stupid but yet funny idea. We see this kid get mad over the name. Sometimes, when he's used to it, it's usually not that bad.</b></p>
        <p><b>Tylor Minich, also known as Schmuel online, which it was also protrayed based off of a sad movie/novel called the boy and the strped pajamas, was a running joke between two other people, Schmuel's cousin, Connor, and ZAlpha himself. Since Schmuel was doing some stupidly funny things either on a video game, or in real life, just no matter where it can happen or what could happen, there is always a schmuel moment. This is why I can include it not only in a Roblox game as a joke, but there is a game about it somewhere.</b></p>
        <p>There are funny sounds among Schmuel screaming his face off by  doing some really stupid things, like bonking things on his head, like a turtle of some sort. Though chances are it may not look like a turtle, but it looked like the kid was ramming something on his forehead about something. Sometimes his antics are really funny to watch. But seriously, you gotta check out the packs located on the download section below!</p>

        <h2>Schmuel History</h2>
        <p>when Schmuel is at his prime</p>
        <h3>2016 to 2019 - his start, and prime years</h3>
        <p>Since at around 2016, Schmuel started to build a heavy bondship with ZAlpha (me) when we were all young. Since around then, we had a lot of time to really much make some memories.</p>
        <p>In 2017, the prime moments of Schmuel started. It all started when me, Connor, and Schmuel himself started to play Minecraft all together in one place. It was on an old Xbox 360 I used to use until it finally died in 2019. Since those times, there were a lot of fueling rages that built among comedic purposes. Filled with a lot of funny faces that sparked some very iconic pictures that had a lot of anger, yet having a lot of careful thought behind it. It was the day when Tylor screamed so loud it made meme history! Logically Speaking.</p>
        <p>At the end of the prime years, it turned into more of a climax, actually keeping some good grand memories about him, especially with his "diet coke" face.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <blockquote>Face of Schmuel of 2019</blockquote>
        <br>
        <h3>2020 to now - the bland side</h3>
        <p>Times have changed. Since the end of COVID-19, things were not the same as they used to about 5 years prior among what type of moments we make on YouTube nowadays. Connor would have or wouldn't have another day for telling Schmuel himself (Tylor, again) to script his amps. One example was recorded on November 2020, apart of him being his old self when he was wanting to, there was a lot more than of what did happen, like another example was hitting a cardbord box.</p>
        <br>
        <img class="smidge-scoot" src="images/Miller-Lite-Suitcase-24pk-12-oz-Cans_1.png" width="400">
        <br>
        <blockquote>This is the same box Schmuel has pwned from afar.</blockquote>
        <br>
        <p>After 2021 is over, Schmuel wasn't too much of the same. Needless to say that he was sucking up his choices and is starting to become more blunt since the start of the 2020 decade. It is <i>very</i> rare to see him be all mad. The marathon and collection of photos honnor his memory of being his crazy self. We love you Schmuel. If it weren't for you being around, then this website would not exist.</p>
        <h3>What about today?</h3>
        <p>Well, recently from what I've came across is something about him being the most blunt. When he would rage, he just loses interest of what he was doing originally. Which makes it a total buzzkill for the entire plot.</p>
        <p>Now it would feel like we would have to keep our hopes up to find out what EXACTLY makes him feel like his old self, again. We shall hope for the best, and work around the clock to find out what can make him amped.</p>
        <p>Only time will tell, folks.</p>
