        <h1>Welcome to the website where I post the SchmuelCraft resource pack for Minecraft Java only!</h1>
        <p id="textgrow-big">Recommended to view this site on a computer!</p>
        <h2>About the packs</h2>
        <h3>Schmuelcraft</h3>
        <p><b>These are dedicated for the use of Java Minecraft only. At this time, there is a small possibility that there is going to be a bedrock version of this resource pack. Only time will tell when that'll happen.</b></p>
        <p><b>These packs are kept on a google drive for a while at this point, so i would send the dedicated link how you can download them directly from this website for free!</b></p>
        <p><b>The one main idea is to piss him off! YouTube may or may not accepot this for what it is and how it was created, but hey! at I got a website dedicated for minecraft resource packs!</b></p>
        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p><b>This all started in 2019. My one friend named Connor actually decided to make up a stupid but yet funny idea. We see tis kid get mad over the name. Soemtimes, when he's used to it, it's usually not that bad.</b></p>
        <p><b>Tylor Minich, also known as Schmuel online, which it was also protrayed based off of a sad movie/novel called the boy and the strped pajamas, was a running joke between two other people, Schmuel's cousin, Connor, and ZAlpha himself. Since Schmuel was doing some stupidly funny things either on a video game, or in real life, just no matter where it can happen or what could happen, there is always a schmuel moment. This is why I can include it not only in a Roblox game as a joke, but there is a game about it somewhere.</b></p>
        <p>There are funny sounds among Schmuel screaming his face off by  doing some really stupid things, like bonking things on his head, like a turtle of some sort. Though chances are it may not look like a turtle, but it looked like the kid was ramming something on his forehead about something. Sometimes his antics are really funny to watch. But seriously, you gotta check out the packs located on the download section below!</p>
        <h2>People that ZAlpha personally hates, can that be added in?</h2>
        <p>That is going to be discussed as time progresses.</p>
